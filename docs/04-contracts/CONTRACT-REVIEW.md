## Governing rules

This document derives from upstream baselines and does not redefine domain ownership, architecture topology, security posture, or historical semantics. Identity is deterministic and batch-resolved for v1; tenant scope is explicit; raw strong identifiers are never persisted; Party identifiers are immutable; hometown is a read-only consumer.

## 1. Result

**PASS — suitable for baseline.**

## 2. Findings

No critical, major, or minor contradictions. The contract set preserves architecture ownership, canonical vocabulary, deterministic v1, tenant scope, temporal history, data minimization, and hometown read-only behavior.

## 3. Readiness

The contract baseline is sufficient for Security, Engineering Standards, Testing, DevOps, and AI Factory derivation. Product-specific OpenAPI/JSON Schema files shall be generated in implementation from these normative standards and validated against them.

## Change control

This document is immutable after release except through the approved ADR and change-control process. Every implementation artifact must cite this document and its upstream architecture references.

## Document control

This controlled document is immutable in this release. Changes require the approved ADR and change-control process. Cross-references use Constitutional Document IDs; filenames are non-authoritative.
