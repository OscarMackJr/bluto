## Governing rules

This document derives from upstream baselines and does not redefine domain ownership, architecture topology, security posture, or historical semantics. Identity is deterministic and batch-resolved for v1; tenant scope is explicit; raw strong identifiers are never persisted; Party identifiers are immutable; hometown is a read-only consumer.

The acceptance suite includes the seeded CRM/ledger/Intrepid identity demo, ambiguous-review case, merge history, split correction, no-readable-identifier audit, cross-tenant collision, and ID non-reuse exercise.

Each acceptance test records environment, data seed, ruleset version, commands, expected state, events, hometown result, audit evidence, and pass/fail decision.

## Change control

This document is immutable after release except through the approved ADR and change-control process. Every implementation artifact must cite this document and its upstream architecture references.

## Document control

This controlled document is immutable in this release. Changes require the approved ADR and change-control process. Cross-references use Constitutional Document IDs; filenames are non-authoritative.
